<h1>Javascript Calendar</h1>

<p>
	I originally wrote this javascript calendar in 2001.
	The original code is <a href="https://github.com/shortdark/javascript-calendar" target="_blank">here</a>.
	The javascript prints the month then draws the visual calendar beneath with today's day highlighted.
	At one point this code would have been able to go forwards and backwards through the months, but the code I found was just displaying the current month.
</p>
<p>
	Having just re-formatted slightly, it's looking better than it was.
