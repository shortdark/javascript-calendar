<h1>Javascript Calendar</h1>

<p>
	I originally wrote this javascript calendar in 2001.
	The <a href="https://github.com/shortdark/javascript-calendar" target="_blank">original code</a> looks like a version of the original javascript with the HTML updated somewhat in 2016.
	This code you are looking at is from the <a href="https://github.com/shortdark/javascript-calendar/tree/2021" target="_blank">2021 refactor</a>.
	The javascript prints the month then draws the visual calendar beneath with today's day highlighted.
</p>
<p>
	At one point this code was able to go forwards and backwards through the months.
	I can't remember but maybe just the next and previous month.
	The code I found was just displaying the current month.
</p>

<script src='calendar.js'></script>
<script>
	calendarMonth();
</script>
